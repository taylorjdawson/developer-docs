description: Overview of API resource limits for different Supernotes plans.
---

Supernotes offers different plans with varying levels of access and limitations when it comes to API usage.
Here's a brief overview of what to expect with the Starter (Free)Plan versus the Unlimited Plan in terms of API resource limits.

### Starter Plan - Limited Access

The Starter Plan provides "limited" API access. Initially, you are allocated 40 cards.
If you utilize the API, for example, to create a new card every day, your requests will start to fail once you reach this 40-card limit.
This limitation is why we describe the Starter Plan as offering limited access to the API.
After 40 days of adding a card daily, you would need to upgrade to continue uninterrupted API usage.

### Unlimited Plan - Enhanced Access

Upgrading to the Unlimited Plan removes the card limit, ensuring that API requests to create new cards will not fail due to reaching a specific limit.
Additionally, Unlimited Plan users are granted "trusted" status, which significantly reduces the likelihood of encountering rate limits.

#### Special Previews for Unlimited Users

As a token of appreciation for their support, Unlimited users who actively use the API are occasionally invited to trial big
feature releases on a separate test database. This exclusive access allows Unlimited users to experience and provide feedback
on new features before they are rolled out to all users.

By choosing the plan that best fits your needs, you can optimize your experience with the Supernotes API and ensure that your
projects run smoothly without interruption.
